## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to classify news articles in Tamil from the **Dinamalar** dataset. The goal is to accurately predict the news category based on the title and content of the article.

## Features
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with TF-IDF Vectorization
- Classification using Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation through multiple metrics such as Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve
- Visualizations for a better understanding of model performance

## Installation
To run the project locally, you need to set up the necessary Python environment.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dinamalar-ML-Project.git
   cd Dinamalar-ML-Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset as shown in the provided sample format.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (`Dinamalar-ML-Project.ipynb`) to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

### Running the Model
Once the environment is ready, follow the steps in the notebook to:
- Preprocess the text data using TF-IDF
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate the performance through visualizations and metrics

### Example Plots:
- **Confusion Matrix**: A visualization to help understand the accuracy of model predictions.
- **ROC Curve**: Shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Evaluates the precision and recall trade-offs for each category.
- **Feature Importance**: Displays the most influential words in predicting the category of a news article.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Tamil news articles from the **Dinamalar** newspaper, labeled with categories. The data is preprocessed and converted to numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.

### Sample Dataset Structure:
- `news_id`: Unique identifier for each article
- `news_date`: Date and time of the news article
- `news_category`: Category of the article (e.g., "Tamil", "India")
- `news_title`: Title of the news article
- `news_article`: Full text of the news article

Ensure that the dataset is structured in this format for smooth processing.

## Model Details
- **Text Vectorization**: The text data is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression is applied for classifying news articles.
- **Label Encoding**: Categories are encoded into integer labels using `LabelEncoder` for compatibility with the model.

## Evaluation
The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using the following metrics:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps visualize the model's classification performance.
- **ROC Curve**: Evaluates the classifier's ability to distinguish between different categories.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Useful for understanding the precision and recall balance.

## Results
The model performs well in predicting the categories of news articles in the **Dinamalar** dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and plots are provided in the notebook for further insights.
